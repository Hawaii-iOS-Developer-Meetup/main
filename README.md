We are a group of iOS developers in Honolulu, Hawaii USA that meet weekly to discuss iOS development with an emphasis on Swift 3 and Xcode 8. 

Learn more about our organization on our meetup page: https://www.meetup.com/Hawaii-iOS-Developer-Meetup/

Come share your projects, ask for help, and meet other iOS developers toiling away on everything from passion projects to enterprise applications for the iOS platform.
